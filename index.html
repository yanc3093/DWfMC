                    About this project
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project was a group school assignment completed in September 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were provided with an operational database that stores and maintains all of the business transaction 
                    information required for the daily operation of a cinema company in an Oracle account. The objective of this 
                    project was to design and create a data warehouse that could be used to answer a series of online analytical 
                    processing (OLAP) queries.

                <p>
                    This project was executed in 3 stages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Explore the operational database and clean the data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Design and implement the data warehouse represented by 2 versions of star schema diagrams.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Generate Business Intelligence (BI) reports based on the Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) queries.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In the <b>first stage</b>, I was responsible for producing the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to represent 
                    the structure of the operational database.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/1.png" alt="Entity Relationship Diagram">
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the <b>second stage</b>, my teammates and I produced the 2 versions of star schema diagrams together.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Version 1 has a high level of aggregation and a low level of granularity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Version 2 has no aggregation and the highest level of granularity.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After that, we equally distributed the implementation part among ourselves. I was responsible for writing the 
                    code to create several dimension and bridge tables. Below is a snippet of my codework, which was written using
                    the SQL programming language.

                <p>
                    In the <b>third stage</b>, I was responsible for producing the Business Intelligence (BI) reports based on the 
                    following 3 Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) queries:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What are the top 5 movies that sold the most tickets in 2020? Display the names and the reviews of movies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What movies made up the top 5% revenue of cinemas in Melbourne? Display the names and the reviews of 
                        movies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do the movies booked through mobile app rank based on their total sales revenue?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Below is a snippet of my codework and one of the Business Intelligence (BI) reports produced for the third 
                    stage.
